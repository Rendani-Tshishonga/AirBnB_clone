## AirBnb Clone

**Description of the project**

The AirBnB project will serve as the precusor to developing a well defined
framework for a clone to the AirBnB website. We will manage the various objects of 
the website through a command interpreter.

**What is a command Interpreter?**

A command interpreter is any program that allows the entering of commands which would then be
executed to the operating system. Command interpreters accept lines of text from a keyboard 
as commands and then converts those commands into functions that the OS understands.

**How to start it**

We will start the command interpreter by using the cmd.Cmd module to create a while loop
throught the cmdloop function and ensure we have a consistent prompt to receive our commands.
The cmd module is a python module for command line interpretation and has built-in functions
or commands which are executable.

**How we will use it**

The project will use the command interpreter to manage objects of our project by:

	- Creating a new object(ex: a new User or a new Place)
	- Retrieve an object from a file, a datbase etc
	- Do operations on objects(count, compute, stats)
	- Update attributes of an object
	- Destroy an object
